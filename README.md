# TryHackMe SOC Level 1:     

### https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1

## Objective: 
To build foundational blue team skills through hands-on labs focused on threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. This training reflects the practical tasks completed during the certification and demonstrates core SOC responsibilities in simulated environments.

## Skills Learned:

- 🔍 Log Analysis: Analyzed system and network logs to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and trace attacker behavior.
- 🧠 Threat Intelligence: Researched threats using open-source intelligence (OSINT) and correlated data for context and response.
- ⚠️ Detection Engineering: Worked with Sigma rules to write and customize detection logic for SIEM systems.
- 🚨 Incident Response: Followed structured triage processes to assess and respond to real-world attack scenarios.
- 📚 Report Writing: Documented findings clearly and accurately to simulate real SOC analyst deliverables.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Splunk – For log ingestion, searching, and dashboarding.
- Wireshark – To inspect packet captures and analyze network-level attacks.
- Suricata – High-performance network IDS/IPS engine used for deep packet inspection and alerting based on rule sets.
- Sigma – For creating and modifying rule-based detections.
- Kibana/ELK Stack – Used to simulate SIEM environments.
- Linux CLI Tools – Including grep, cat, cut, awk, and less for searching logs, parsing data, and navigating system files.
- Sysmon – Collected detailed event logs for detecting malicious behavior.
- MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) – Used for sharing threat intelligence indicators (IOCs), TTPs, and other cyber threat data.
